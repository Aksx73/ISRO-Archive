# ISRO-Archive
#### Android app showing Launched Spacecrafts & Rockets data of ISRO using [ISRO ðŸš€ API](https://github.com/isro/api). App is built to demonstrate Modern Android Development.


## General info

It loads data of Spacecrafts, Launcher, Customer Satellites and Centres data of ISRO using [ISRO API](https://github.com/isro/api). Using retrofit we fetch all the json data provided by the api and display on the user screen.<br>
App is organized in MVVM architecture. Whole app is organized with intent to create archtecture like in multi-module approach - that is why there are packages like: data, domain, ui(presentation). Also, SOLID rules were applied.
