## About

It simply loads data of Spacecrafts, Launcher, Customer Satellites and Centres data of ISRO using [ISRO API](https://github.com/isro/api). Use retrofit to fetch all the json data provided by the api and display on the user screen.<br>
Data will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized.
App follows clean architecture pattern (MVVM + Usecases). Whole app is organized with intent to create architecture like in multi-module approach.
